Transition slide between high-level to product screens
Notion of integration - "connect them"
  **explicitly say integrated, one place, etc**
  say in an elegant way how you connect them in a way that saves the
  teacher a ton of time
  better done with blocks than screens
  talk about enabling new things - LiveLecture
Beginning was good - needs to be tightened up
Background color? "A little depressing"
"With budget cuts, we all know class sizes are growing - we know this will
only become a bigger problem."
"With today's tools, managing a classroom takes more time."

"This is what the desktop of a productive, tech savvy teacher looks like"

New slide - outline what they do online today
  -all separate applications intended for the business world, 
  -separate logins, etc


"Wouldn't it be great if all this was in one site"
--Slide fades out
"we make teachers more productive"
  "we builed teacher productivity tools"

make sure they understand the issues - "organizing content isn't something
that i, as an investor, don't understand"

"not only are we integrating functionality that exists in separate applications, like filebox (dropbox for schools) or our gradebook or attendance, but we're also doing new stuff. this is only the first pieces of many that we're going to build"

"examples of value having everything all in one place" (live lecture)

"you're not going to educate them about what's better about what you have in only 4 minutes"

"classconnect and a chromebook is all you need for a fully one-to-one classroom"

ways to end: say we'll give you a demo, something to that effect
